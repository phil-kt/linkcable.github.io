    <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Over the summer, I, like many others, became obsessed with the augmented reality game known as Pokemon Go, and found myself every day after my internship trekking through Central Park to hunt some Pokemon. During this playtime, and after the craze died down, I was interested in designing and developing an augmented reality experience of my own for people to try out.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Upon arriving to Georgia Tech, I discovered that there was a lab dedicated to augmented reality in the <a href=\"http://ael.gatech.edu/lab/\" target=\"_blank\">Augmented Environments lab</a>. One of my fellow classmates was going to work on a project for the lab and she invited me to come to her next meeting with the professor. I accompanied her, met <a href=\"http://www.jdbolter.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Bolter</a>, and began work on Understanding AR.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Concept</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Understanding AR is a project inspired by Scott McCloud's book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Comics\" target=\"blank\">Understanding Comics</a>, which is a meta work that describes how to write and draw comics through the use of comics. Professor Bolter really liked this work, and wondered if we could do the same with augmented reality: create an augmented reality application about augmented reality. My partner, Victoria, and I took up this challenge and sought to create an AR book about the history and development of AR. We identified what we considered key moments in augmented history worth representing:\n              <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_(virtual_reality)\" target=\"_blank\">Sword of Damocles by Ivan Sutherland (1968)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoplace\" target=\"_blank\">Videoplace by Myron Kreuger (1975)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeTap\" target=\"_blank\">EyeTap by Steve Mann (1980)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality\" target=\"_blank\">Augmented Reality term invented by Thomas Caudell (1990)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_fixture\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Fixtures by Louis Rosenburg for Air Force (1992)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"http://artoolkit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ARToolkit by Hirokazu Kato (1999)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"http://wearables.unisa.edu.au/projects/arquake/\" target=\"_blank\">ARQuake by Bruce Thomas (2000)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\" target=\"_blank\">Google Glass beta test (2013)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Hololens (2015)</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"http://www.pokemongo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PokemonGO (2016)</a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              With these 10 milestones in mind, we set out to develop a book that could tell this history of how augmented reality came to be in today's day and age.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Implementation</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              In order to create our storybook, we used the augmented reality framework developed by the lab called <a href=\"http://argonjs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Argon.js</a>. It's a javascript framework developed by <a href=\"https://blairmacintyre.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Blair MacIntyre</a>, the head of the Augmented Environments lab. We used Argon along with <a href=\"https://twinery.org/\">Twine</a> and <a href=\"https://aframe.io/\">a-frames</a> to create our AR experience.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The general workflow was that I would create 3D models of the historical event we wanted to signify, and save them as .obj format so that they could be plugged into an a-frame and be rendered on the web. Once we had the model, we would write up a description of the event in Twine, and link it all up to a main storyline. We also had to save the images we wanted in <a href=\"https://www.vuforia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vuforia</a>, so that looking at an image would trigger the correct model to render.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Some Models</h2>\n            <Carousel className=\"carousel\">\n              <div>\n                <img src={eyetap} alt=\"eyetap model\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>3D model of EyeTap in Blender</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={argon} alt=\"argon model\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>3D model of Argon logo in Blender</p>\n              </div>\n            </Carousel>\n            <h2>In Action</h2>\n            <Carousel className=\"carousel\">\n              <div>\n                <img src={google_glass} alt=\"eyetap live\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Presenting to Professor Bolter with the Google Glass model</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={quake_live} alt=\"quake live\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Presenting to Professor Bolter with the Quake model</p>\n              </div>\n               <div>\n                <img src={quake} alt=\"quake\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>What you actually see from the iPhone itself</p>\n              </div>\n            </Carousel>\n          </span>\n        }\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Argon;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/pages/portfolio-pages/argon/Argon.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './Dots.css';\n\nimport PortfolioPiece from '../../../components/portfolio-piece/PortfolioPiece';\nimport transparent from '../../../media/transparent.png';\n\nclass Dots extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <PortfolioPiece\n        title=\"Dots\"\n        content={\n          <span>\n            <h2>Description</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Made for an art class in undergraduate with after effects and inspired by the Google dots from <a href=\"https://design.google.com/articles/evolving-the-google-identity/\">Google's branding</a>, it was <a href=\"http://zuccairegallery.stonybrook.edu/2016/05/senior-show-2016-awards/\">bought by Stony Brook University’s president</a>.

We tried to think of the best way we could combine these two aspects, and add in a creative aspect to these ideas through art.\n             </p>\n            <h2>Implementation</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n               We eventually landed on an augmented reality app that allows you to draw on any surface around you, and when you or anyone else with the app comes by that same spot they can see what you drew! All drawings are anonymous, and can only be viewed by those in the same location as you looking at the same wall, ceiling, floor, what have you. In order for graffiti to work we used the gyroscope and GPS to gather location and orientation data to maintain the context the graffiti is drawn on so that you don't see random drawings floating in the air (unless intended to be placed there!)\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For this project I coded the front-end in Swift using AVFoundation and some invaluable cocoapods (<a href=\"https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit\" target=\"_blanl\">SnapKit</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/gizmosachin/ColorSlider\" target=\"_blank\">ColorSlider</a>, jot, and <a href=\"https://github.com/scalessec/Toast-Swift\" target=\"_blank\">Toast-Swift</a>). I also created all the assets and screens you see. Much help to <a href=\"https://github.com/IFTTT/jot\" target=\"_blank\">IFTTT's jot libary</a> which was instrumental in finishing the app within 48 hours.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Design Sketches</h2>\n            <Carousel className=\"carousel\">\n              <div>\n                <img src={front} alt=\"front end logic of graffiti\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p className=\"sketches-description\">Sketches of the initial screens of graffiti, and the front end logic of a drawing layer, a camera layer, and the main activity layer.

Although this is nowhere as good as user research, for the purpose of this class it made sense as the professor already had the app and its general features in mind.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Scenario</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">Thomas is a middle-aged businessman taking care of his older father, Harry, who is now living in his family’s home. Harry is about 80 years old and has to take several pain medications for this arthritis, and has recently been diagnosed with depression due to his lack of ability from old age. However, Thomas has many clients across the country requiring him to travel often and not be home to check on his father.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For his depression, Harry has been prescribed Zoloft, and Thomas is very concerned that Harry takes it properly to keep his father in good spirits, along with his regular pain medications. To help alleviate his fear, Thomas has bought a new internet connected pill dispenser which allows Thomas to check on Harry’s medicine schedule from wherever he may be. The device has segmented areas for different pills, and allows Thomas to set individual times for each pill to be dispensed from a companion iOS app.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The companion app pairs with the pill dispenser through NFC, so that it can be used by other members of Harry’s family to check in on him. The app itself shows a daily schedule of what pills Harry needs to take for the day, <a className=\"figure figure-1\" href=\"#\">(Figure 1)</a> and can provide detailed information about any medication, such as what its was prescribed for, what its possible side effects are, and when the next refill is required, with a simple tap. <a className=\"figure figure-2\" href=\"#\">(Figure 2)</a> Harry can also choose to refill in advance if he so feels from the screen, which will contact the pharmacy on file to schedule a refill for him to pick up.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Thomas can also edit information about the medicine, including its dosages and reminder times. He can set different priorities on the pills, so that Thomas can be notified immediately if Harry does not take his Xanax, but is less concerned about whether Harry takes all of his pain medications or not <a className=\"figure figure-3\" href=\"#\">(Figure 3)</a>, as well as see a weekly and monthly breakdown of how vigilant his father is at taking his medications.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In case Harry does miss a medication, Thomas will get a push notification with information about what medication his father didn’t take, and can choose to take action about it, at which point he will see detailed info about the medicine his father missed, and given the option to call Harry, their doctor, or 911 depending on the severity of the situation. <a className=\"figure figure-4\" href=\"#\">(Figure 4)</a>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Thomas is very happy with his new app which allows him to monitor his father’s health while on the go, and is excited to see what other features this dispenser and app combo have to ensure his father continues to live a healthy life. Without this app, Thomas would have no way to consistently and easily keep tabs on his father, and would not be able to ensure that his father is taking the medicine he needs to stay healthy. His father also gets the benefits of consistent reminders, and peace of mind knowing that the machine handles the task of tracking medication for him.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Figures/Concept Drawings</h2>\n            <Carousel className=\"carousel\">\n              <div>\n                <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_1} alt=\"schedule\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Figure 1: A schedule of the day</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_2} alt=\"detail view\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Figure 2: A detail of the medication</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_3} alt=\"editing view\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Figure 3: Editing a medication's details</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_4} alt=\"missed medication\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Figure 4: Push notification for a missed medication</p>\n              </div>\n            </Carousel>\n            <h2>Low Fidelity Prototypes</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Using the concept drawings I drew up some low fidelity prototypes, fleshing out the details a bit more.\n            </p>\n            <Carousel className=\"carousel\">\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_1} alt=\"Lofi schedule\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>The schedule screen</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_3} alt=\"Lofi medication view\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Medication detail view</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_2} alt=\"Lofi medication editing\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Editing a medication</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_4} alt=\"Lofi list of medications\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Viewing the list of medication</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_5} alt=\"Lofi calendar view\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Calendar view of medications</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_6} alt=\"Lofi profile view\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>A profile of the patient</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_7} alt=\"Lofi missed medication view\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>Missed medication notification</p>\n              </div>\n            </Carousel>\n            <h2>Persona</h2>\n            <p>\n              Based off of our initial scenario, we then developed personas to better flesh out the caretaker who would be using our app and the needs we would have to meet to ensure that they would use this app. So I further fleshed out the character of Thomas, and what he is looking for in taking care of his father.\n            </p>\n            <img src={persona} alt=\"thomas dean 56 years old kpmg accountant\" style={{margin: \"0\", maxHeight: \"136px\"}}/>\n            <p>\n              Thomas is a middle-aged accountant at KPMG, 46 years old, who is taking care of his 80 year old father Harrison, or Harry, who lives with him and his family. Harry is currently taking several different pain medications for arthritis that came with old age due to his profession as a mechanic, and has also been prescribed Thalitone for blood pressure in the mornings and Prilosec for heartburn. He must take these medications daily in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and Thomas is very worried about his father properly taking these medications.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In order to ensure his father takes his pills properly, Thomas is interested in a pill dispenser with a companion app that allows him to track his father’s pill intake and alerts him if his father misses a dose so he can follow up with his father or the doctor to keep Harrison healthy. Due to his work Thomas is often not home and although his family is there to help take care of Harry, he would like to have extra peace of mind so that it’s ensured that his father never forgets to take his medications.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Key Goals of Thomas:\n              <ol className=\"list\">\n                <li>Be able to check his father’s medication schedule for the day</li>\n                <li>Be notified when his father misses a dose</li>\n                <li>Easy to contact his father or a doctor when a medication is missed</li>\n                <li>Be able to see when his father misses his medication over a week or month term so that he can see patterns if there are any as to why his father might miss a dose</li>\n              </ol>\n            </p>\n            <h2>Medium Fidelity Prototype</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">After low fidelity mockups came the medium fidelity ones which were used for user testing.</p>\n            <iframe className=\"invision-embed\" width=\"438\" height=\"930\" src=\"//invis.io/DX90SMQU4\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n            <p>\n              In this prototype the following tasks are incorporated:\n              <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>\n                  A user is able view all four tabs of the app, which include Schedule, Medicines, Calendar, and Profile\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  From the Schedule or Medicines screen, users can click on a medicine to see details about a particular medicine, and click on the edit button to edit medication information\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  From the Calendar screen a user can see missed medications, and click on a past day to see the schedule for that day\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  A user can also filter missed medicines based on priorities of the medicine\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  When a medication is missed, the app gives a notification that a user can tap to see details on the missed medication and act upon it if they want to (see this <a href=\"https://invis.io/ES90SOATH#/198511415_Home_Screen\">here</a>)\n                </li>\n\n              </ul>\n            </p>\n            <h2>User Testing</h2>\n            <p>Using the medium fidelity prototype on Invision, I sent it out to two people for user testing:\n              <ol className=\"list\">\n                <li>my mother, a licensed physician who is currently practicing in a private clinic and could provide insight from a medical perspective</li>\n                <li>a fellow MSHCI graduate student who could find simple usability issues and heuristically evaluate it</li>\n              </ol>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              My mother provided some great feedback (as mothers tend to do) from a doctor's point of view:\n              <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>\"Time of medication should be simpler, either 9am or 9:30am\"</li>\n                <li>“Priorities classification is not useful”</li>\n                <li>“No one calls the doctor for one missed dose”</li>\n                <li>Appreciated how medication details show the side effects, and have refill button available</li>\n                <li>Likes the ability to see purpose and potential side effects of a medication</li>\n                <li>Maybe only show pills he misses on the calendar, otherwise can get busy</li>\n                <li>Would like to be able to make memos on the calendar on patient’s condition to discuss with doctor next visit</li>\n              </ul>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              As for my fellow classmate, choice feedback included:\n              <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>Priorities are a bit confusing</li>\n                <li>It was hard to figure out how to call my patient</li>\n                <li>Calendar was intuitive to see days he missed</li>\n                <li>Intuitive and makes clear use of iOS design guidelines</li>\n              </ul>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              After this feedback it is clear that I should incorporate a proper onboarding process to describe what exactly the priorities mean.

This was my first foray into industrial design, so working with Autodesk Fusion 360 was pretty fun, and getting to 3D print our design was awesome to say the least. </p>\n\n            <Carousel className=\"carousel\">\n               <div>\n                <img src={brainstorming} alt=\"notes of designs\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>\n                  Brainstorming the physical device and its screens\n                </p>\n               </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={moodboard} alt=\"moodboard\" className=\"portrait\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}}/>\n                <p>\n                  A moodboard showing inspirations and guiding principles\n                </p>\n               </div>\n            </Carousel>\n\n            <p>For my design, I decided to make my physical design a watch, as it is ubiquitous, its form is familiar to the older generation and they are also more likely to wear a watch. It is also less cumbersome, and has the advantage of being able to give subtle vibrations as a notification system. </p>\n\n            <img src={autodesk} alt=\"designing in fusion\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              The final design in Autodesk Fusion 360\n            </p>\n            <p>The watch is a simple LCD screen watch, with two buttons on the side to interact with the device. (Our professor forbade us from using touch screens, so no touch interactions!) Too many buttons would only serve to confuse the user on functions, and on screen cues help guide the user on what to press. The buttons can also be twisted, to allow scrolling, and have different colors. The band can also be swapped out, for the fashion conscious.</p>\n\n            <h2>Physical Prototype Display</h2>\n\n            <img src={faces} alt=\"wireframe of physical watch\"/>\n            <p>For the screens on the device, I didn't want there to be too many states or screens that might confuse the user. The watch basically serves as a reminder and a logger, it reminds a patient when it's time for their dose, and they can see what medication they've taken so far today and be told what they've missed, which could be useful information for the caretaker or the doctor. </p>\n\n            <p>On its standard state, the watch simple shows the time and when your next dose is, as well as what you've taken so far using the color coded system.

I also think I made a pretty slick lookin' watch.</p>\n\n            <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>\n            <p>For the final leg of this project, we had to create a high fidelity prototype of the interface that would be on the pill dispensing machine. The dimensions were 480 by 320, and the design of the device itself was given to us, we just had to make the interface. </p>\n\n            <p>The device itself is meant to be able to be a standalone device, which means that all settings, interactions, controls, etc, had to be on the embedded screen, no accompanying app. Features of the device include:\n              <ol>\n                <li>Onboarding</li>\n                <li>Medication set up</li>\n                <li>Editing settings</li>\n                <li>Notification of medication dispensing</li>\n                <li>Standby or day to day operation</li>\n              </ol>\n            </p>\n\n            <img src={wireframe} alt=\"wireframe of device\" />\n\n            <p>\n              With these features in mind, it was relatively quick to create a wireframe of the device as I had standard assets across all three devices. Once these wireframes were reviewed by my professor, I then created an interactable prototype in Framer.js, fleshing out the interactions.\n            </p>\n\n            <iframe className=\"device\" src=\"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl/\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen=\"allowFullScreen\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              <a href=\"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to view on Framer</a>\n              {\n                window.matchMedia(\"(max-width: 680px)\").matches ?\n                <p>Because this is an embedded screen device on a custom device, your screen must be wider to view it.

I was able to learn a lot about Framer.js, and also a little about how physical design works with Autodesk Fusion 360.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            If I were to expand on this project, I would like to user test it more thoroughly, such as see if the color classification system I came up with is useful, and if there are any confusing parts of the information architecture of the app, perhaps with a card sort. But I hope you enjoyed reading about this project as much as I enjoyed making it :)\n            </p>\n          </span>\n        }\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Medi;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/pages/portfolio-pages/medi/Medi.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './Rendezvous.css';\n\nimport PortfolioPiece from '../../../components/portfolio-piece/PortfolioPiece';\nimport watch from '../../../media/portfolio/rendezvous/rendezvous_apple_watch.png';\nimport flow from '../../../media/portfolio/rendezvous/rendezvous_flow.png';\n\nclass Rendezvous extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <PortfolioPiece\n        title=\"Rendezvous\"\n        github=\"https://github.com/LinkCable/rendezvous\"\n        devpost=\"https://devpost.com/software/rendezvous-fsu7xd\"\n        prototype=\"http://share.framerjs.com/t8thbcf7jgdz/\"\n        content={\n          <span>\n            <h2>Origins</h2>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Do you enjoy the joy of spontaneously encountering your friends when you're out and about?

When our team first arrived at the huge Wells Fargo Center where PennApps XII was being held, we couldn't find each other and barely had cell service! This led us struggling for a solid hour to try and find where we as a team had settled down to work.

Thus, when two friends happen to be close to each other, such as at the same dining hall or in the library, you can be notified that your friends are nearby! It's also useful if you lose a friend at a concert or in the woods where you have no cell service.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For this app I made the front-end in Swift and designed all the screens you see below.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Wireframes</h2>\n            <img src={flow} alt=\"wireframes for rendezvous\" className=\"wireframes\"/>\n            <p>\n              Simple three screen user flow, a user signs up by using either Facebook or their contacts so we can know which one of their friends is on the platform.
